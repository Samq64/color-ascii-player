# Color ASCII Player
A Curses Python script that uses ffpyplayer to play colored ASCII videos in the terminal with YouTube support.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Windows will also need to install `windows-curses`.

On some Linux distributions a Python virtual environment might need to be created first.

```bash
cd colour-ascii-player/
python -m venv ./
source ./bin/activate
```
